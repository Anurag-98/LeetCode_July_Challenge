Question : Given a 2D board and a word, find if the word exists in the grid.

           The word can be constructed from letters of sequentially adjacent cell,
           where "adjacent" cells are those horizontally or vertically neighboring.
           The same letter cell may not be used more than once.

Example:

        board =
        [
        ['A','B','C','E'],
        ['S','F','C','S'],
        ['A','D','E','E']
        ]

       Input word = "ABCCED", Output : true.

       Input word = "SEE",    Output : true.
 
       Input word = "ABCB",   Output : false.
 

Constraints:

1) board and word consists only of lowercase and uppercase English letters.
2) 1 <= board.length <= 200
3) 1 <= board[i].length <= 200
4) 1 <= word.length <= 10^3
